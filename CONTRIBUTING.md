## How to contribute to Smart Valor Network


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [slack or gitter link] and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.


#### **Did you find a bug?**


* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/smartvalor/ValorNetwork/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. 


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.



#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Smart Valor Network Code in the [slack or gitter]().
